# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 1, 2020 (Data Structures - LinkedList)

**Today's Progress**: I have developed java program on LinkedList to get complete knowledge on LinkedList 

**Thoughts:** Explored java.util.LinkedList and understood implementation of the class internally. 

**Link to work:** [Sample](http://www.example.com)

### Day 2: August 2, 2020 (Data Structures - LinkedList)

**Today's Progress**: Developed Custom LinkedList class and implemented below methods
1. addFirst
2. addLast
3. deleteFirst
4. deleteLast
5. indexOf
6. contains

**Thoughts**: I really enjoyed implementing above methods


### Day 3: August 03, Monday (Data Structures - LinkedList)

**Today's Progress**: I have completed below exercises on LinkedList

1. Convert LinkedList to Array
2. Reverse LinkedList in two ways
3. getKthValueFromTheEnd

**Thoughts** I have implemented reverse of LinkedList on my own and learnt another way of implementing Reverse of LinkedList. 

### Day 4: August 04, Tuesday (Data Structures - LinkedList Exercises)

**Today's Progress**: I have completed below exercises on LinkedList

1. Find middle number in LinkedList.
2. Check if LinkedList has loop.

**Thoughts** Great to know the logic for finding middle number(s) of LinkedList. 

### Day 5: August 05, Wednesday (Data Structures - Stack)

### Day 11: August 11, Tuesday (Data Structures - LinkedList, Queue)

**Today's Progress**: It was tough to set head and tail pointers after reversing linkedlist. 

1. Reverse of LinkedList using recursion

### Day 12: August 12, Wednesday (Data Structures - Queue)

**Today's Progress**: Enjoyed implementing this logic.
